TM-01 is a programming framework for issuing, maintaining and publicly trading security tokens.

## Purpose 

Tokenization is a method to convert rights to an asset into a digital token - digital representation that lives on a blockchain. Security tokens represent tokenized securities like equity, debt, or royalties. Tokens retain the regulator status, but still enjoy the benefits of blockchain techology being faster, low cost, more global and efficient over traditional paper based legacy counterparts.

TM-01 provides tools to integrate security tokens to IT services, like issuance and secondary market services. The tools are open source under Apache 2 license. We strive to maintain 100% openess for the core toolchain, so that independent providers can easily work with security tokens.

## Compliance

TM-01 aims for compliance for publicly traded securities in EMEA regions and private placements in USA. 

* EU MIFID Multilateral Facility (MTF) for publicly traded securities
* EU MIFID Investment Category 3 (CAT3) - for primary issuance and private placements
* Dubai DIFC Authorized Market Institution (AIM) for publicly traded securities
* Singapore MAS Capital Market Intermediates - for primary issuance and private placements
* USA SEC broker-dealer  - for primary issuance and accredited investors only

## Structure

The project is split to four different source code repositories

* Smart contracts - security token representation in a blockchain
* Corporate governance - voting, dividend, forced trade revert and other company board activities
* Shareholder registry - identity verification and know your customer registrations
* Consolidated tape - post trade transparency service across multiple trading venues

Each repository comes with a Python library, scripts and application to deal with the underlying activity. 

## Technical compatibility

The underlying smart contracts are written and tested under multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine implementations. They can run on the following blockchain chains

* Ethereum public mainnet
* Rootstock (RSK) public mainnet
* Ethereum permissioned implementations, like Monax in IBM Hyperledger

## Other

There is no ICO or utility token involved.
